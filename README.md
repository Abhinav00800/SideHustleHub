# Sidehustle - Empowering Local Entrepreneurs


## Introduction

Sidehustle is a dynamic platform designed to empower local entrepreneurs by enhancing their visibility and reach within their communities. By offering a user-friendly interface for business owners to list their products and services, Sidehustle bridges the gap between small businesses and customers eager to discover unique, locally-sourced goods. 

What sets Sidehustle apart from other platforms is its commitment to providing both business owners and customers with a more personalized, neighborhood-focused shopping experience. Unlike mainstream e-commerce giants, Sidehustle focuses on showcasing local businesses that often get overlooked. For business owners, this platform offers a unique opportunity to stand out in their community, list products at competitive prices, and reach customers directly. Customers, on the other hand, benefit from the ability to explore hidden gems in their area, with the added advantage of comparing prices to mainstream markets. This ensures that they always get the best deals while supporting local entrepreneurs.

Sidehustle leverages a modern tech stack to provide a seamless experience for both business owners and customers:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to handle the large volume of data generated by product listings, customer interactions, and business profiles.
- **Express.js**: A flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building dynamic web applications and APIs.
- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building the user interface (UI), creating an interactive and responsive design.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that handles the backend operations, ensuring fast and scalable performance for the platform.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web pages with a rich set of pre-designed UI components.
- **REST API**: A standardized protocol for enabling communication between the front end and back end, ensuring smooth data transfer and interaction.
